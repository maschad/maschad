[Wah Gwaan?](https://jamaicanpatwah.com/term/Wah-Gwaan/1199) ðŸ‘‹

My general interests are in peer-to-peer networks, distributed systems and [Local-first software](https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first/).

I'm currently scaling out [Arda Network](https://www.arda.xyz/) which is the universal operating system for real estate.

I also help maintain [js-libp2p](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p)
