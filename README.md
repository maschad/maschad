[Wah Gwaan?](https://jamaicanpatwah.com/term/Wah-Gwaan/1199) ðŸ‘‹

My general interests are in permissionless peer-to-peer networks, distributed systems and [Local-first software](https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first/).

I'm currently scaling out [Atoma Network](https://www.atoma.network/) which will provide the necessary infrastructure for fully private local-first AI.

I also help maintain [js-libp2p](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p)
